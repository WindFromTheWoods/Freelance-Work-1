а=7.63; 
b=-4.85,
xi=(-3.6; 7.8; -4.2; 3.5; -0.6; 2.8; 4.2).


TASK 2

Develop algorithms for processing a two-dimensional dynamic integer array (nхn matrices; the user enters the value of n from the keyboard; parts of the matrices are selected according to the figures below) in accordance with the two parts of the task of the variant, program them in the form of functions.
The matrix is filled with random numbers from -10-Number of your option to 10+Number of your option [-10-V … +10+V, where V is the number

Notation used:
*3 - sector with elements of both diagonals;
3\ - sector with elements of the main diagonal;
3 - sector without diagonal elements;
3 is some number that the user enters from the keyboard.
Where "3" is the sector number.

In sector 9, count the number of elements whose values are equal to zero. In sector 2\, count the number of elements and replace the elements with the minimum value of the matrix.
